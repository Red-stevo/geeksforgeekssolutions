# Problem Statement.

Given an unsorted array A of size N that contains only non-negative integers,
find a continuous sub-array that adds to a given number S and return the left and
right index(1-based indexing) of that subarray.

In the case of multiple subarrays, return the subarray indexes which come first on moving from left to right.

Note:â€”You have to return an ArrayList consisting of two elements left and right. In case
no such subarray exists, returns an array consisting of element -1.

## Example 1:

Input:
N = 5, S = 12
A[] = {1,2,3,7,5}
Output: 2 4
Explanation: The sum of elements
from second position to fourth position
is 12.

## Example 2:

Input:
N = 10, S = 15
A[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
Output: 1 5
Explanation: The sum of elements
from first position to fifth position
is 15.
